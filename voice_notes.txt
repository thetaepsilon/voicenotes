... that's better.

this is a bit of my brain in a sense.
it is not guaranteed to make sense.
there are no promises the info here is complete.
there is no guarantee that you will not be mislead when you read it if you interpret something differently.
it is written for me and just published as a mild novelty.
you've been warned, lads and lasses.
now, on with the show.






[...]
for working on pitch range, even if resting from other drills...
try speaking then moving it an octave (for instance) up and repeat? would that work?

	charles:
	you can, just note that it may only be part of a sentence you have to fix up.
	but yes, redo that inflection etc. inside the target pitch range.

[...]
what would be your recommended order for drill stacking when doing both OQ and high larynx, and any specific ones or does it vary?
(and is there anything to know about drill stacking in general as I've not done it much yet)

	charles:
	larynx first, then downwards OQ slide, then big mouth to small mouth (not heard that one before!).
	make sure you're locking in things as you go along!



[asked savvy about making creak easier...]
	airflow vs closure.
	make sure to balance closure if going louder doing it.



[asked ama when and how to use sovtes]
	they help abduction to work more efficiently (hence the lack of strain?), helps reach higher pitches.
	it can help to do repeatedly in quick succession.



[if the M1-M2 break is inadvertently disguised sometimes, how the heck does one listen out for it?]
	charles:
	there's a volume test, you can't get shouty in M2.
	apparently this is a thing one student of charles's they go over.
	(rip no premium to access archive)



[...]
ama mentioned a muscle reflex that can happen when airflow is increased, your muscles will involuntarily tense.
thinking about counteracting this seemingly helped fix that issue where low weight refuses to work when tired...
[why does that happen?]

	ama:
	it can be a learned conflation between airflow and parts of yelling
	(e.g. that could be high weight... you end up fighting yourself! >_<).
	e.g. you instinctly tense up to do other parts of yelling from the airflow sensation.




[heard there's a check for M1 or M2 where M2 can't go loud. what actually happens if you try to go loud in M2?]
	apparently on the low end you just go into airplaning.



[...]
my vocal chords keep getting sore and end up feeling stiff when practicing {low weight} even mildly
(yes I'm drinking loadsa water and resting cautiously),
causing me to lose my voice two out of every three days
(unless I force {high weight} which probably makes it yet worse).
could something be wrong?

	charles:
	try glottal strikes, but be careful about form... apparently if you need them most get it wrong.
	the typical case he sees is random fluctuations of insufficient vocal chord contact.
	if glottal strikes and adduction care don't fix that it'd need more thorough diagnosis (rip)

[...]
I have noticed when practicing larynx drills, even with my tongue in an open position for "aaaa" say,
my vowel sounds will shift more towards "eeee".
what things can cause this?
(I already know twang can interfere a tiny bit,
would mouth space and R2 being whack in general impact this too?)

	adi says:
	could be disproportionate mouth space.
	try scaling a tongue-out ehhh sound.
	throat spaces could be changed by going from a dark e to a bright o?
	suggests doing it in steps as slides can screw this up.

	Adi
	e has high r2 low r1 
	o has low both r1 and r2
	ratio wise ig	// <- important bit

	masc e to fem o thats mostly an r1 shift
	masc or fem o to e for an r2 shift

[...]
{adi} had identified that even in my normal speech there is some false fold interference.
this came up when I noticed trouble adducting correctly for low weight in a practice session with them,
so have been trying to practice retraction but having some problems.
even when trying to actively retract, when I speak it comes back in,
and when I stop talking my breath is briefly raspy until the retraction pulls back again.
so the drills themselves are not currently sufficient because my speaking habit seems to override it,
and I have no idea how to break that behavioural association.
taking a desire to retract FVF in my voice as given, what would be your drills and strategy for achieving this?
willing to demo but not sure how best to make it heard)

	jana:
	breath in like through a straw then do an aaaaa.
	that actually seemed to hold more reliably than the others, stay tuned I guess?



[asked about proneness to soreness during low weight]

	adi:
	sovtes may help.
	the whole never not used without FVF before may influence but adi doesn't want to speculate.
	however if that was the case practice _all_ sounds without FVF (including the antiexercises!).
	if it were to keep up, get thee to a speech therapist!
	(GPs may be crap, know that drill...)



[...]
can {low weight} be interfered with when raising larynx due to compression?
(I heard something along the lines of there being less space in a raised position.)
I have suddenly found myself unable to produce any sound with {low weight} when phonating after BDSD and whisper siren drills,
so I was wondering if such an effect could be the culprit and what to watch out for / how to counteract if so.

	charles:
	tl;dr yes, but it /should/ be possible to overcome with a drill.
	completely being unable to do the drill (and having to do the opposite, high weight)
	is outside the usual problem set. may require interactive debugging with a teacher.
	there's otherwise not a magic hack beyond practice.

[...]
how common is it to accidentally twang if you do a larynx drill incorrectly or otherwise mislearn it (yes I know I just have to practice this one!)
and presumably it helps to avoid this if one always resets properly when re-drilling?

	charles:
	yes, very common. apparently there is actually more to this one!
	"widening" the throat like one gets when yawning can help with this.
	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faucalized_voice apparently mentions it,
	note pharygneal widening/expansion.

[...]
what is M3 physically and/or why is it contested whether it exists independently?

	not contested if you are well read apparently heh.
	just by people who can't do it according to charles.
	it's apparently hard to film according to wiki,
	but charles knows it as only anterior (frontwards) parts of the folds being allowed to vibrate.



[could you describe more thoroughly and technically what a glottal strike is? is it always just a full glottal stop done repeatedly?]
	pretty much, perhaps not total closure all the time though (just a highly adducted state).
	but not to be confused with glottal _onsets_ which is starting from adduction but is unlikely to be from a full stop because that's fricking hard!
	the latter can be used to fix breathiness but can also be used to get a stronger M2 partly because a lot of people's M2 is overabducted.
	jana reckons not for creak though apparently (for that, try going to M0 then raising it up) (they say doublecheck with charles!)
	(it is also used in transmascs for weight.)



[...]
I've noticed at the top of my M2 pitch range I feel a distinct pressure from inside my head against my ears which makes going further (vocal bits aside) somewhat uncomfortable.
  what's going on here, and is this expected?

	charles:
	it could be several things.
	could be some extra muscles firing, intracranial or facial muscles?
	it could also just be such high air pressure that you're straining;
	charles suggests lip trill SOVTEs for that.

[...]
could you explain in more detail what is that thing involving the pencil or chopstick under the tongue fixing?
  is it to do with the tongue being connected to larynx position somewhat?

	jana:
	your tongue can tend to end up in things like stitch or otherwise doing undesireable things in some part when you're initially straining things connecting to it like larynx height.
	the tongue out exercises forces the tongue to stay put more and other things move independently.
	_this is not failsafe_ however!

	as an addendum: you can also do it temporarily by pulling your tongue out gently or trying to touch your chin with your tongue,
	or doing things like "la-la-la" to force your tongue to stop locking up.
	these are _even less failsafe_ though.

[...]
do you have specific exercise recommendations for exploring/controlling nasality... like to do with moving the soft palette I guess?

	adi:
	one of them is actually a balloon... imagining humming into blowing up a balloon.
	if your sound was nasal it would be going through the nose, so the air from the 'loon would backfeed through your nose!

	on more everyday note...
	plosives tend to close the soft palate to build up the pressure else they don't work.
	try "ho ho ho" vs a nasal form that sounds (in adi's word) like "french baguette" (lol!)

	note that some sounds, like "oh", are almost entirely oral, so don't change if nasality is modified.

	also note:
	/technically/ as long as the airflow is not entirely nasal, if you block the nose,
	the resonant cavity is still there, but will sound muted.

[...]
repeat occurence when playing around with {low weight} that I'd like some input on:
at first I have to watch my adduction to produce sound, but after a while it's like it's flipped...
I then have to abduct to _not_ produce a pitch just when I breath out without any muscle input.
and if I try to adduct from there like I normally would, I feel considerable tension in my throat and eventually feel sore.
could I be accidentally over-adducting after I've warmed up here or any other ideas?

	jana:
	suggested a slide going from adducted to abducted to try and get them to behave.


	charles:
	try terminating a note cleanly under an sovte.
	yaga had a similar problem where she could not terminate phonation
	(she'd end up falling down in pitch as her vocal folds relaxed but did not part).
	/could/ be just muscle spasms (spasmodic dysphonia, or reaaaally rarely paradoxical vocal fold motion),
	but that's conjecture.
	defo try to get it in a clip!



[I asked jana about decoupling resonance and weight control conflation]

	jana:
	says ensure repeated back and forth sliding weight works first.
	then, do that at different pitches.
	_then_, do that at different _resonances_.
	basically brute force combination exercising.

	make sure you don't FVF, or otherwise fall into the trap that you have to force or bear down at elevated resonance.
	if you ever make a sound that sounds like strain, stop and try again.



[...]
what is going on in M1 range expansion when one wants to do that?
what's being worked on / changed physically and mentally during the practice of it?
(not exercises as such, more what they're helping build - e.g. I was curious if there's any muscle changes to increase M1 pitch range)

	savvy:
	reckons it's mostly just a question of building control but didn't feel able to comment much on physiology.

	charles:
	depends on range as it goes through different stages at higher pitches and also whether you're not singing/belting or not.
	there's apparently an element of withstanding the necessary pressure to get M1 at those higher pitches though.
	otherwise said it is very specific to the person as there's a bunch of things that can obstruct it.
	he also reckons that it's unlikely you'll get past F4 in any case,
	and it's a bit of recurring a mental trap to think you need to do that in M1 to sound passable -
	at that point it would be vastly easier to make M2 more natural sounding / more speech like.

[...]
do you have any recommendations on stealth fem re-drills, or ways to drill I can sneak into everyday conversation I can use without people noticing too much?

	savvy:
	suggests with the resonance one it can eventually become silent if pitch.
	try "singing" with the resonance pitch also.
	not really for weight but controlled breathing can help and could be snuck in.
	be careful not to dry yourself out, though again if you reduce volume this can also improve.



[how does one do a rolling R? (if there's a single particular one used by the scots that's the one I'm thinking off)]

	apparently the tongue tip is the thing doing the trill and is placed behind the upper teeth ridge,
	but the entire mouth has to be closed off by a raised tongue overall so sound is forced to go through the tip (and causing it to vibrate).



[can you re-explain why the M2 to M1 transition in a {low weight} slide if we start too high has a tendency to screw up the drill's effect?]

	ama:
	it doesn't always happen! depends on M2 comfort beforehand.
	apparently if you use M2 a lot already for instance it won't happen.
	even a break or lack of is not a distinguishing factor.
	but one surefire way it would be is if you really never use M2 at all and consider it a drastic switch...
	causing the config to get reset.


	charles:
	there's a sane limit as it is in any case, but:
	you can strain if you go too high into untrained M2, which can end up bringing strain down with it too!
	also, if you are used to fix rate and time sliding, you won't move far enough down to get into M1 to begin with.



[...]
I feel the need to clear my throat a lot when combining high larynx and {low weight} atm.
I don't seem to actually move a lot of substance though
(like not much actual stuff gets coughed up) so could this be something I should keep an eye on?
sign of minor strain perhaps?

	charles:
	more likely the larynx being raised
	the space is reduced above it so apparently the sensation of anything in there can get amplified.
	it should pass with time, keep an eye on it.

[...]
what's the reasoning behind the drills you specifically chose for {larynx height} and {vocal weight}?
different teachers prefer different drills,
so I was curious what your rationale was.
e.g. ease of listening to it?
these particular ones easier to teach or most reliable in your experience?

	charles:
	"long story", though is mostly just the most familiar with them,
	particularly with troubleshooting and form.

[...]
I've asked this before ish but I wished to refresh my knowledge:
if one encounters persistent soreness doing a required modification for vocal gender alteration,
even if done in small amounts then resting, what is one generally speaking supposed to do?
rest for a day or two then try starting again slowly? and then what if that still doesn't work?
and then so on etc., like is there a firm point we should say get thyself to a doctor?
(this is partly for myself in future but also for what I can responsibly advise to others when answering in the question channels,
without overstepping my boundaries.
I don't want to encourage bad behaviour or accidental vocal harm.)

	charles:
	mentioned laryngeal massage during practice but didn't have time to go into detail.

[...]
what would you recommend for decoupling resonance from pitch?
I seem to have an issue where a) my resonance is tied to my pitch as it moves,
and b) where I can do a resonance exercise while using the noise measurement technique,
but it gets overriden when I go to phonate, causing me to lose it.

	savvy:
	recommends doing resonance on a steady fixed pitch.
	e.g. try yawning (low resonance) then going to the same pitch.
	then normal, then raise it.
	once you have those stops, try sliding between them.

[...]
a few months ago I was diagnosed with a form of tinnitus where my hearing is way oversensitive.
according to doc this causes me to hear things inside my body disproportionately loud, e.g. my heartbeat
(yes I can hear that just sat still), but I'm starting to think this may be affecting how I hear my voice internally -
e.g. I can't hear my improvements in resonance (or when it starts to decay if I fall out of practice)
over my head conducting my fundamental and sounds of air wooshing,
as the latter are way louder to the point of drowning out any other detail.
how boned am I, or rather what would your advice be to ensure this doesn't interfere in my training?

	charles suggests building a comparison from recording vs internal.
	otherwise you'd have to try and build from other feelings
	(e.g. even deaf people can speak sometimes).
	also, people can filter for a whisper in a loud environment,
	so charles suggests trying to develop that to hear /past/ the bias that I am experiencing.

[...]
I sometimes find myself imitating even male voices in my fem voice while watching something alone.
do I have to worry much about mirroring causing subconcious masculinisation of subtle behaviours?

	charles:
	don't do it often if you're not that good at the fem voice yet.
	there's defo a subconcious danger unless you know how to separate the subtleties,
	even if you're not trying to imitate male specific patterns.
	"would be willing to impose a blanket ban" <- if that's not a clear hint I don't know what is heh

[...]
could you explain what pressed phonation is technically,
possibly give a brief demo,
when it can occur, why it may be adviseable to avoid it,
and what _would_ one do to avoid it if diagnostics indicated it?

	charles:
	_thinks_ it's glottic or superglottic constriction but it's not very defined.
	apparently voice qualities described as "harsh" by technical peeps are more constrictions above the glottis (superglottic).
	markedly "low glottal flow accompanying high pressure" apparently.
	specifically _not_ FVF though.
	[charles gave up after a bit due to inability to access decent technical info in a hurry,
	didn't get other clauses]

[...]
for voice fem, can you re-explain the interplay that raising larynx has on {low weight} and possibly closure?
IIRC {charles} said something about less space in that position.

	charles:
	larynx slides _IN_ when you raise it.
	compresses interlaryngeal tissues.
	chords more likely to be in greater closure,
	but ironically more likely to be in closed quotient.
	it _can_ affect pitch as well but more for resonance conflation reasons -
	people tend to tie resonance and pitch together.
	(aside: also note timbre changes from other things can muck with percieved octaves!)

[...]
I have heard a rumor that transmascs can use morning voice to explore {high weight}.
is there any scientific basis to this,
and are there potential bad behaviours from this?

	jana:
	"from what i learned, it's a really good time to explore just because the stiffer folds, and mucus kinda allows for buzzier voice.
	it's not good to drill heavily on it though because if you strain on it you're going to feel strained all day"

[...]
"Oh yeah another thing i heard, since I'm younger, 16. Isn't it true that the vocal stuff will adjust easier and more efficiently?"

	charles thinks so for transfem if T puberty hasn't had it's full effect yet,
	as well as mental plasticity / ability to re-wire.
	NOT the main/deciding factor though and conversely doesn't make it impossible when older!
	(at least up to 40's but charles's data falls off)
	teaching style and age group compatibility can have an effect -
	e.g. charles has had greater luck with his scientific approach with older individuals.

	less clear if this effects susceptibility to needing to be in a good head space to practice -
	we know it's a factor overall (people's voices can act up under stress if it's not well practiced),
	but nobody here's a psych so we don't know how much and _certainly_ know nothing about age changing this.

[...]
what's the reason there's not a single common mouth space/embouchre/insert equivalent term here drill
(and is this related to why there's no lounge for it)?
is it one of those things where it varies based on the person and needs more supervision?

	charles:
	it's not a static variable!
	it's hard to drill for that because it's a thing you have to change to even make vowel sounds!
	there is "aah speak from aah, ee speak from ee", but that's a tendency thing.
	it's not something you can drill and lock in place.

	it also touches on being unable to see what muscles are doing.
	_however_ with embouchre, you can see it.
	(if you could see everything teachers wouldn't exist heh)
	in particular, charles considers it an advantage that for people who are visual and kinetic learners,
	that being able to _see_ the things in your mouth will be easier for them,
	so would prefer it be done without needing the drill to cheat you into it
	(and well he organises the lounge sooooo... there ya go).

[...]
could the relaxed, uncontrolled M1-M2 register break move (in pitch) at all when moving the larynx?
(I observed this in myself but wasn't sure if it was just psychological)

	charles:
	in terms of encouragement/comfort point of crossover point, possibly.
	(remember you can have range to choose in, it's not absolute. whack that gender essentialism!)
	that said, larynx passively effects vocal fold adduction.
	so it could indeed be influenced - higher larynx would encourage M1 at higher notes.

[...]
are there any cases where it'd make sense to isolate OPC from the rest of embouchre,
and where it'd produce any useful sound change on it's own?
asking because someone wanted to hear a clip of it in isolation,
and at the time to my knowledge it was rarely done like this.

	charles:
	*does examples*
	you can isolate it and it does produce _some_ difference alone but not really a useful one.
	it's really a small part of embouchre and that's a dynamic set of things that varies with speech.
	it's not really useful to listen to it in isolation therefore.

[...]
I heard excess mucus movement or need to clear one's throat (or both)
_\_specifically when voice training\__
can be a sign of strain or overdoing something,
there any truth in this and if so what's going on to cause?

	charles:
	more the feeling, like psychologically stressed and aware of small disturbances.
	could be a sign of hyperadduction as well.
	high larynx can also make one more aware of it.
	however any actual felt mucus is likely to be underlying issues.





# misc tips
reducing airflow, all else constant... go from voice sss sound to zzz (note not really a vowel) sound, removing the "s-iness" in the slide.
try opening into "aaaa" at the end to check.

terminology NB: talking about favoured harmonics from a voice's resonance is actually formants...

vowel sounds can be determined by resonance ratios so try to avoid making them go out of sync...

anchor words have to be created through practice!
they're words where you practice consistency to oblivion,
and then you use them in their anchoring fashion later to restore configs.

references:
whisper - breathiness - clear/balanced - creak/fry (- glottal stop)



a rudimentary vowel set for checking for oddities:
beat bit bet bat bart bort bot blue bus burr bush



𝑺𝒂𝒗𝒗𝒚
sh- f - s
("ssshh", "ffff", "ssss")

𝑺𝒂𝒗𝒗𝒚
j - v - z
("juh", "vuh", "zuh", except not really a vowel per se)

^ make sure these are bright! also the IPA theta /[θ]/ I have trouble with, as in the (proper) *th*is sound.



anti-clocking measure: going into fry early can help disguise where your pitch floor is.

in case of that low weight sticking issue: try the slide up from low creak method.

in the context of low weight... aim for maximum laziness.
(make sure your airflow source is good though!)

when practicing larynx, make sure nothing under your chin is tensing for one thing.
this is one of those times where unnecessary tension can actually be felt as well as the thing you're trying to move!

it can be a thing that FVF constricts under physical and/or mental stress.
if you know a physical situation that causes it (e.g. exertion like lifting objects),
try practicing retraction there (you may encounter resistance, be careful!) in order to break that.

the nature of low weight means there's less in the way of retaining air.
so while breathiness is not low weight, the former tends to be more susceptible during the latter.


Ama /eɪmə/
	"Practice angling it correctly and avoiding touching the walls of the laryngopharynx"

	^ if one is brave enough to get their own endoscope (i.e. camera down the throat)



one can play with mouth space using a brightness (noise pitch) gradient on a ssssss sound.



it /_is_/ possible to find low weight from a yawn imitation.
however that's also low larynx, so high weight would actually be masked until attempting to raise your larynx.



* breath control exercises from some of savvy's other student's lessons:
breathing in/out, first 5, then 7, then 12 for instance...
make sure to maintain constant flow, and _do not_ a) rely on constriction feeling over lung feeling (FALSE FOLDSSSSSS),
or b) tighten something to try to compensate for pressure loss (another trap of mine recently)

try slowing down a voiced gasp:
that's actually a breathy voiced reverse phonation and is very nearly almost always low weight (and forced low airflow).
then slide to forward and reversed phonation in breathing.
exact same pitch in and out is not necessary but try not to shoot of into a reaaaally high pitch when doing it.



apparently sometimes it makes more sense to use brown noise rather than white.
human voices have spectral rolloff like brown noise does (of varying degrees but still),
whereas white noise is equal power in all frequencies.



more on intonation hurdles:
as well as the redoing intonation inside a target pitch range as mentioned in the first question at the top,
it can sometimes help with straining and other weirdness on particular intonation patterns to do it through SOVTEs first.
this can make it easier to then retry speech in that intonation without the anomalies.



resonance exploration:
* brown noise, go as high res as possible, then adding speech
* Adi: first thing noise use external noise,. to explore resonance, right now too much tension, try focusing on resonance in isolation with noise, if youi feel like your hitting a wall or its strained trying the posture little by little and just think what if I squeeze this bit or move this a tiny bit
* Adi: make sure that the posture u find you can breath through comfortably and silently
* Adi: what happens if you try to add voice, do you want to move, try not to
* Adi:
	resonance, voiced resonance gradients, and vowel consistency
	tendancy to drift in vowel e.g. towards a when high res or oh when low res - we dont want this to happen because it builds bad habits
* Adi: we also want to work on pitch resonance separation as that may be a root for why stuff sounds likeu cant get as high res as when exploring

red flag:
if you hear someone say soft palate excessively instead of nasality: RUN
soft palate does not contribute to sound itself!
bad pedagogy alert!
(especially if they say "room" or needing to move it for laryngeal configs,
that's anatomical BS)


charles:
don't abandon the drill just cos you get muscle memory of it,
cos that muscle memory might not be as extreme as the drill can do.
*really commit* to the drill, really do it thoroughly to ensure you're doing it properly.





vocal fold pressedness of the hyperadduction kind is somewhat orthogonal.
(charles demo'd it - you can go OQ or CQ while staying in what he calls a "stiff" posture,
roughly sounding like having difficulties on the throne as it were.)
most notably it sounds like the pressed phonation will make the quotient harder to hear;
the former's sonic effect seemed louder. close listening required.

assistance for any voice masc helped:
if embouchure gets conflated,
try doing a small embouchure to ensure any deepness comes from larynx alone.

so yawning isn't quite the best thing to use for larynx lowering either,
but apparently it's nowhere near as bad as the cursed SAH.
